# Problem with running the part_2_MP.
# for some reasons, the dictionary house_visited if not being updated correctly by the process_house_part_2.
# The results AFTER house 50 (51 and on) we SHOULD NOT get presents from elf #1 anymore since he already
# gave in the first 50 houses. This problem occurs when even house_visited is defined as a global.
